    """ PROBLEM:
        The problem is, that in the code, a package which is used tries to reference sklearn.ensemble.forest. 
        But that is deprecated. So the code needs to be updated to use the new package.
        But I can not update the code of the package. 
        So I won't be able to test out, which will work and which won't. But I still want to explain the general
        idea what we would go for to solve the task.
