Story;"Beyond the waves: Alex Ayed’s journey";"At the Fondation Louis Vuitton in Paris, viewers are invited to follow the Franco-Tunisian artist, from the North Sea to the Mediterranean";"Alex Ayed is already sailing offshore. Where? Amidst the blue and salty vastness. In a space that suspends ordinary time, making way for imaginary tales and picaresque poetry.\nIt must be said that everything had been carefully orchestrated down to the very last detail. Last October, during the second edition of Paris+ par Art Basel, the artist inaugurated his evolving exhibition at Fondation Louis Vuitton in Paris.\nThe title of the show, ‘Farewell’, is to be taken at face value. Within the foundation’s ‘Open Space’, a program showcasing emerging artists, Ayed (who was born in 1989 and graduated from Beaux-Arts de Paris in 2015), bid land dwellers farewell. The day of the opening, the artist embarked on a world tour by boat. Visitors can follow his odyssey through the main work in the show: various screens mounted on a tall radio antenna display his daily observations, poems, and other micro-narratives.\nIn Paris, Ayed simultaneously presented ‘Letters from Kattegat’ at Balice Hertling, a solo show expanding on a series of wall-mounted works made by stretching weathered sails over canvas. As part of Paris+ par Art Basel’s public program, the artist had installed a dovecote in the Tuileries Garden, crafted from olive wood, clay, and whitewashed straw – providing respite for flying messengers.\nIn 2021 Ayed participated in the two-person show, ‘Laws of Confusion’, with Lydia Ourahmane at the Renaissance Society in Chicago, and was included the same year in the New Museum Triennial, ‘Soft Water, Hard Stone’, in New York. Materials are always symbolic in the artist’s practice; olive oil and desert sand carry myths without words from North Africa. Another recurrent presence within his minimal sculptural gestures: dead animals – a seagull, a chameleon, a grasshopper. The works resemble characters in a fable, entrusted to the elements and swept away by the wind."
Story;"Painter Sean Landers unleashes his critters in Paris";"Animals enjoy a special status in the American artist's works, currently on view at Musée de la Chasse et de la Nature";"A hare fills the frame, looking at us. It is attentive, on high alert, even. It looks ready to scarper at the slightest noise. The animal’s liveliness seems almost proverbial – like a rabbit caught in the headlights? This woodland creature, painted by the American artist Sean Landers in 2023, can currently be found in the heart of Paris, surrounded by numerous other critters. With painstaking detail, the artist has traced each individual hair of the animal’s brown fur and outlined the pearly veins of its hollow, perked-up ears. Landers was born in 1962 and since the 1980s, a decade known for its forays into conceptual art, he has been, anachronistically, working on figurative painting. With playful and poignant erudition, he draws on different painting traditions from European art history. Among his diverse personal pantheon of artists are William Hogarth, Nicolas Poussin, Théodore Géricault, and Édouard Manet. However, it is his interest in Surrealism that often stands out, particularly the influence of René Magritte. I Live – the title of the painting – is a classic bust portrait, apart from the fact that it is of an animal. By representing the animal this way, the painting’s subject is magnified as well as transformed into an individual. Although this style of painting dates back to antiquity, it actually responds to a certain view of the world that comes from the Renaissance. The position of the painting’s protagonist echoes the era’s nascent spirit of humanism, which placed humans at the center of the world. When Sean Landers paints a hare, it’s not just a painting of a hare. Landers created the piece specifically for his solo exhibition ‘Animal Kingdom’ at the Musée de la Chasse et de la Nature in Paris, in which around 30 of his artworks are on display. A selection from one of his most well-known series is on the museum’s first floor: Animals with their fur coats decorated with tartan patterns are depicted in countryside settings. The exhibition unfurls over two floors and its juxtaposition with the permanent collection creates a dialogue with the taxidermized animals and other hunting curios. The hare is exhibited in the ‘Tick Room’, named after one of the research subjects of the biologist and philosopher Jakob von Uexküll, a pioneer of the study of non-human perception. Through I Live, Sean Landers also becomes an ethologist. The animal is seen from an animal’s point of view. Anthropocentrism may well have been one of the things we inherited from the modern age, but the current era is trying to break away from it. The hyperrealistic depiction of the painting’s protagonist takes place against a background of a birch forest. The tree trunks, carved with messages and other graffiti, can be read like the pages of a diary. After all, unlike humans, the forest listens without judgement. By combining the bust portrait style and the motif of tree trunks that function like speech bubbles, Landers creates a psychological portrait of the animal. Refusing to focus solely on exterior perceptions, Landers uses the carved messages, written in the first person, to give us access to his inner world. In the specific case of I Live, the subject is not particularly verbose. The hare represents pure existence; it is total coincidence, captured in the moment. For example, one short message gets across its nervousness: ‘I only hear what I fear.’ Or, further down, ‘I only know where I go’ – short messages like mantras, taken from the intuitive wisdom of animals. The hare is not asking himself questions: He goes, he lives and never looks back. It is a philosophy for life: Our existence is too short for indecision!"
Story;"Artist-led initiatives are transforming Accra into a world-class cultural hub";"Collaboration, community-building, and care have turned Ghana’s capital into a creatives’ heaven";"In 2011, the Ghanaian poet, musician, and spoken-word artist Poetra Asantewa decided things needed to change. Asantewa had been performing in front of live audiences across Accra, Ghana’s capital, for a year. However, she felt that the city did not offer the infrastructure she needed to succeed. She knew she was talented, but also that it was not enough. The turning point, she said, was the thought of building a community of like-minded creatives. By collaborating with fellow artists who had similar wants, needs, and goals, she would gain access to an audience, support, resources, and a network, ultimately contributing to the city’s cultural ecosystem. Her intuition would prove her right. That collaborative and transdisciplinary mindset is now the bedrock on which Accra’s vibrant artistic and cultural scene is built. A cosmopolitan city and, of late, a top tourist destination, it is home to some of the world’s most lively, creative, and colorful scenes. ‘I needed people, places, community, a place where I could fail, a place where I could experiment, and I didn’t want to do that in a self-centered way,’ Asantewa said in a recent interview with Art Basel. In 2017, Asantewa, who describes herself as a ‘community catalyst,’ founded Black Girls Glow, an Accra-based feminist non-profit, providing space for female artists – including singers, songwriters, rappers, poets, and producers – to collaborate. In 2018, she launched Tampered Press, a literary arts journal and workshop series showcasing the work of local authors. Alumni of both organizations have since initiated their own participatory initiatives. ‘Yes, I’m building for myself. But it’s not only for me. I am building for the artists around me, the artists before me, and the artists who are yet to come,’ says Asantewa, whose first collection of poems, titled Woman, Eat Me Whole, was published by Ecco, an imprint of HarperCollins, in 2022. Her new book, a collection of stories titled someone birthed them broken and published by Amistad Books, will be released in April. Interest in Ghana’s cultural output has steadily grown over recent years. In the art world, artists from Ghana and its diaspora such as Amoako Boafo, El Anatsui, Serge Attukwei Clottey, and Ibrahim Mahama have been exhibited in major museums across the globe. Ghana’s 2019 Venice Biennale pavilion was a standout, featuring, among others, work by luminaries Lynette Yiadom-Boakye and John Akomfrah – both are British of Ghanaian heritage. In turn, Ghanaian artists are investing back into their country. Boafo’s dot.ateliers, a three-story, David Adjaye-designed building, includes spaces for exhibitions, a library, and studios for artist residencies. It was ‘born on the back of collaborations and community,’ said Boafo in a 2022 Cultured magazine interview and will welcome its second wave of residents this year. Similarly, painter Kwesi Botchway parlayed his success into creating opportunities for other young visual artists, officially launching his Worldfaze Studio and Residency in Accra in August 2023. Beyond the capital, collective blaxTARLINES and artist Ibrahim Mahama have garnered attention with their community-based work in Kumasi and Tamale, respectively. In a nod to Ghana’s rise on the global art map, blaxTARLINES and Mahama were included in ArtReview’s 2023 Power 100 list, a ranking of influential art world figures published annually. So was gallerist, engineer, and art collector Marwan Zakhem. With three spaces in Accra and a fourth in London, Zakhem’s Gallery 1957 represents and exhibits some of the biggest names of the art world in Ghana, Africa, and its diaspora, including Boafo, Botchway, and Clottey. (Gallery 1957 will also participate in Art Basel’s 2024 Hong Kong edition, its first showing at the fair.) But as Poetra Asantewa’s story shows, Accra is not only fertile ground for fine artists. Late last year, American essayist Audrey Shipp hosted a workshop at the 2023 edition of Pa Gya!, a literary festival in Accra. Collaborative efforts between the diaspora and Africans on the continent is an idea Kobby Ben Ben, author of No One Dies Yet appreciates, saying that events like these are ‘necessary in the literary ecosystem in Ghana, especially in a global literary ecosystem that favors artists that only can afford Western MFA accreditations for publications.’ Ben Ben’s debut novel, published by New York’s Europa Editions, has received rave reviews from The Africa Report, Publishers Weekly, and The Guardian. Set in 2019, the book follows a group of American friends visiting Ghana with two antagonistic logal guides on the occasion of 400 years since the first recorded arrival of enslaved Africans to the Americas. Ben Ben says that collaborative literary efforts between diaspora and Africans on the continent help ‘smoothen the social bridges’ that exist between the two communities. The current generation of Ghanaians on the continent and in the diaspora are documenting and reflecting on the country’s story in their own, resourceful ways, reclaiming a narrative that was until recently defined by external voices. They are also creating the structures necessary to do so. Like Poetra Asantewa, the photographer, filmmaker, and curator Paul Ninson decided to resolve the roadblocks he faced early on in his career ­– he could not find a place to read books on photography or access resources and a community for support – by creating his own organization. ‘I started photography [in 2017] and never had a community,’ says Ninson, ‘so why would I build an institution not focused on community?’ In December 2022, Dikan Center, the non-profit institution founded by Ninson and ‘dedicated to educating the next generation of Africa’s creative leaders,’ was officially launched. Dikan means ‘take the lead’ in Twi, one of Ghana’s local languages. Located in the South Labadi neighborhood, the center houses what is billed as Africa’s biggest photography library, with some 30,000 books and Dikan Gallery, dedicated to photography. It also has studios, offices, classrooms, spaces for events, a production room, a photography archive, and a record player along with a collection of old highlife music vinyls. The center has hosted several workshops over the past year, including one co-led by Pete Souza, the official White House photographer during the Obama presidency. (Souza’s ‘Obama: An Intimate Portrait’ exhibition is on view at the center’s gallery until February.) Dikan Center recently graduated the first cohort of its Photojournalism and Documentary Practice certificate program and subsequently showed their work in an exhibition. This year's programming includes a fellowship in journalism and documentary practice and an exhibition on highlife (a major element of Afrobeats, the generic term that refers to popular music from West Africa, particularly Ghana and Nigeria.) ‘I am here [in South Labadi] because of [painter] Amoako Boafo. He introduced that “let’s all be together” mindset, and I brought other people together. I am trying to get Poetra [Asantewa] to come closer. I am trying to pull [other people] to come closer,’ says Ninson. The intersectional nature of Accra’s creative hubs is key in making them successful. At Lokko House, for example, visitors can browse and purchase work by African designers, but not only that. Founded in 2008 by creative director, designer, and curator Stefania Manfreda, the space hosts concerts, art exhibitions, music listening sessions, and other events. Similarly, the non-profit organization Surf Ghana, founded in 2016 and led by Sandy Alibo, is behind initiatives such as the East Legon-based community sports, recreation, and art hub, Freedom Skate Park, as well as Vibrate Space, a music studio and educational program accessible to local musicians. According to Poetra Asantewa, the likes of Ibrahim Mahama, Paul Ninson, and Sandy Alibo, ‘who have seen some kind of stability in their work,’ are crucial to the ecosystem. They have created dynamic structures and cultural institutions; they have dedicated time and energy to building up the country’s artistic community. This approach has been paramount to strengthening Accra’s cultural dynamism. ‘The work I put into my practice is not only to build my trajectory but also building people and institutions around me who can thrive on their own and who I can also lean on,’ Asantewa concludes. Gameli Hamelo is a journalist, writer and researcher documenting arts and culture in Africa and its diaspora."
Story;"Hans Ulrich Obrist remembers Agnès Varda";"The Serpentine’s artistic director reflects on his many encounters with the legendary French filmmaker, from their first Venice Biennale to their last lunch";"I arrived in Paris in 1991, having received a grant to be curator-in-residence at the Fondation Cartier. One of the very first studio visits I did was with Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster, who told me to watch Agnès Varda’s films. That day, we talked about bringing the worlds of documentary, fiction, art, and literature together, about Varda’s immense curiosity, and her idea that she had a friendship with time and enjoyed its passing. Eleven years later, in 2002, with Molly Nesbit and Rirkrit Tiravanija, I started to work on ‘Utopia Station’ for the 50th Venice Biennale, which was directed by Francesco Bonami. ‘Utopia Station’ was based on Édouard Glissant’s idea of ‘utopie du tremblement’ and the various ways it could be imagined or defined. The exhibition presented works by more than 60 artists, architects, writers, and performers, including Yoko Ono, Martha Rosler, Anri Sala, Tino Sehgal, Liam Gillick, and Glissant himself. Finally, the opportunity arose to collaborate with Agnès. I felt that her work around food, such as her documentary Les glaneurs et la glaneuse (2000) on rural and urban gleaning practices in France, revealed a utopian streak in her work, and that it would therefore be interesting to include her in the exhibition. I called Christian Boltanski and Annette Messager who were both friends of hers and asked them if they could introduce us. That’s how the first conversation happened. There, in her magical studio/apartment/garden/kitchen on rue Daguerre, I told Agnès about the project in Venice and explained that the idea was also to rethink the art institution of the 21st century. I remember she told me that if you keep your eyes open, everything is interesting – especially people. When we invited her to participate in ‘Utopia Station’ she said that she’d always wanted to be in the art exhibition in Venice, rather than the film festival in which she had been included many times. Agnès had that desire to go beyond the disciplinary constraints of the film world, where she could only make feature films, documentaries, and shorts. I’ll never forget the day Agnès arrived in Venice. It was during the heatwave in the summer of 2003 and by 11am it was already very hot in the Arsenale. She arrived disguised as a potato with this amazing, now legendary, costume which even emitted sound. Her installation included the video triptych Patatutopia (2003), which celebrated heart-shaped potatoes. She had hundreds of kilograms of potatoes piled up in the exhibition space. The smell of them hung in the air and you were allowed to touch them. It was a multisensory, multiscreen environment, not just something with one frontal view. This project triggered a whole new chapter and a new approach for Agnès, enabling her to develop new multidimensional cinematic spaces and experiences. Over the last 15 years of her life, she created art installations at Fondation Cartier, the Biennale de Lyon, Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and many other important venues. It goes to show that when it comes to curatorial and artistic practice, it can be so important to step outside the box. Her now iconic cinema shacks – cabanes de cinéma – are a case in point. She introduced them in her first major solo exhibition, ‘L’Île et Elle’ at Fondation Cartier in 2006. Each shack is created from 35mm film reels of one of her films. The last hut she built during her lifetime, La Cabane de Cinéma: La serre du Bonheur (2018), is dedicated to her first color film from 1965 which scandalized audiences when it was released by addressing the complexities of love and prefiguring the social revolutions of the 1960s. The shack is at the center of the exhibition I have curated with Arthur Fouray, and in close collaboration with Rosalie Varda, at LUMA Arles. The exhibition presents part of my archive relating to Agnès. Indeed, Founder and President of the LUMA Foundation, and Founder of LUMA Arles Maja Hoffmann made the archives an important part of her vision for her project from the very beginning. The shack is comprised of approximately 2,500 meters of 35mm strips. At its center are the sunflowers that appear in the credits of the film Le Bonheur (1965). By deconstructing her films in this way, frame by frame, and foregrounding their materiality, the cabanes de cinéma entirely reinvented the cinema space, offering new non-linear readings of her iconic works. The exhibition also includes my interviews with Agnès over the years; there are nine in total, recorded in different locations. The last conversation I ever had with Agnès, was a very intimate one. I was preparing an Alexander Calder show with Isabela Mora, in Santander, for which I wanted to create a living art history of Calder through all his unrealized projects, his contemporaries, and the people who knew him well. For this I had scheduled to meet Agnès, but about a month before the planned date, out of the blue, I received a phone call from Sandy Rower, President of the Calder Foundation and grandson of the late artist, telling me I should come immediately because Agnès was not well. I took a train to Paris, arriving there on a Sunday morning, and we did the interview about Calder. She told me a story about how they would travel together to the beach and how he would make jewelry for her out of the boot of his car where he kept all his tools – and without which he would never leave the house. What was so extraordinary about this last conversation was that at a certain point Agnès transformed our interview into a lunch. More and more people started to arrive. There was her daughter, Rosalie Varda; her son, Mathieu Demy; Christian Boltanski and Annette Messager; JR and Prune Nourry; Koo Jeong A and myself. I had no idea that this would happen, but it became a farewell gathering since it was the last time she would see her friends. We all made an exquisite corpse drawing and then Agnès called us into her kitchen, where she asked each of the couples to sit at the table and hold hands. Then she climbed up a ladder she had installed and took a photograph of our hands from above. She later sent each of the couples a print of the photograph and created her own work from all of them entitled Les Mains complices (2019). She repeated the process over several days with other friends thereby creating a wall of 19 interlocking hands. I’ll never forget that intimate moment in the kitchen with Agnès and her friends in March 2019. I asked her why she was doing it, and I will also never forget the reply she gave: ‘I was 90 years on this planet, and I want to show that, at the end of the day, what really matters is love.’ Hans Ulrich Obrist is the Artistic Director of the Serpentine in London, and Senior Advisor at LUMA Arles."
