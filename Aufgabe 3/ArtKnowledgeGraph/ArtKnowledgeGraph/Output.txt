2019 Gisela Capitain: How Martin Kippenberger's former accomplice became a Cologne legend The gallerist talks Art Basel through her extraordinary career and revisits the years spent with the larger-than-life artist who set her on her path ‘For me Martin Kippenberger was the beginning of contemporary art,’ says Gisela Capitain . The pair’s immediate connection led to the creation of the now-mythical studio-cum-social space Kippenberger’s Office – Germany’s answer to Andy Warhol ’s Factory. But it’s in Cologne that Capitain found her home. She opened her gallery in 1986 and since then has been a stalwart of the German scene, branching out to Berlin in collaboration with Friedrich Petzel in 2008.
